```

```

3. Install dependencies:

```

## Usage

1. Launch the application:
    - If using the installer version, run the installed application
    - If using source code: `python main.py`

2. First-time Setup:
    - Set your base game folder path in the settings
    - Set your mod folder path

3. Basic Operations:
    - Open mod folder by clicking the "Open Mod Folder" button or dragging and dropping the mod folder onto the application
        - If you are starting a fresh mod, or are new to modding, you can use another mod as a template.
    - Make changes using the intuitive form interface
    - Save changes using the Save button or Ctrl+S
    - Undo/Redo using Ctrl+Z and Ctrl+Y or the buttons in the toolbar
    - Select the player faction using the dropdown in the top right corner

    - Create or delete a player faction by clicking the "+/-" button
    - Refresh any view with the refresh button in the corner (this is needed when making changes to the research tree, and can help fix some issues).

4. Features:
    - Things are styled bold if they are required, italic if they are from the base game, and greyed out if they are non-editable.
    - Right click for context menus.
    - Right click anywhere inside the entity data to add a "root" property (this refresh may take a second, so be patient).
    - Each property and array has a context menu to delete it, or add to it.
    - Each "string" value is displayed as the "type" it is.
        - References to other entities are shown as buttons.
        - References to localized text are shown as two seperate text fields (one for the key, one for the value).
        - References to textures are shown as a text field with a preview of the texture.
    - Each string has a context menu to select from various options.
        - File: Select any file from the mod or base game, and optionally create a copy of it.
            - When createing a copy from the base game you will be given the option to override the file by keeping the same name and not adding it to the manifest.
            - Otherwise it will be added to the manifest and the mod folder with a new name.
        - Uniforms: Select any value from uniforms from the mod or base game.
        - Localized Text: Select any localized text from the mod or base game.
        - Texture: Select any texture from the mod or base game, and see a preview of it.
        - Sound: Select any sound from the mod or base game, and hear a preview of it.
    - View and edit the research tree using the "Research" tab.
        - Change domains with the buttons on the top.
        - Click on a research subject to edit it.
        - Right click anywhere to create a new research subject (copying one from the base game or mod, this cannot be undone).
        - Right click on a research subject to delete it (this cannot be undone).
    - Other tabs are mostly self explanatory.
        - Click on an entity to view its properties in the appropriate panel and edit them there.
        - Refresh any time you feel like the view has not updated correctly.
        - Note that larger entities may take a second or two to load, and adding/removing root properties causes a full refresh.

## Known Issues

- Sometimes the context menu does not appear (or does not show the correct options). If this happens, try refreshing the view.
- Adding or removing a root property to a large entity may take a second or two.
- Strings may become a button to an exotic file when that doesn't make sense.
- Multiple undo/redo operations may cause the application to not show the correct view. If this happens, refresh the view.
- It is possible to undo/redo past what you should be able to do. If this happens, the application may crash.
- Invalid properties will not be shown in the view at all (in the future they will be shown in a different color).
- Player icons, portrait files, and sound files are not yet supported.

## Development

### Project Structure

- `main.py` - Application entry point (use --dev to disable version checking)
- `entityTool.py` - Main application logic and GUI (this file is way too long, I apologize in advance)
- `research_view.py` - Research tree visualization and editing
- `command_stack.py` - Undo/redo functionality implementation
- `version_checker.py` - Update checking and management
- `style.qss` - Application styling
- `config.json` - User configuration storage

### Building from Source

To create an executable:

1. Install PyInstaller:
```bash
pip install pyinstaller
```

2. Build the executable:
```bash
python -m PyInstaller entity-tool.spec
```

The executable will be created in the `dist` directory.

## Configuration

The application stores its configuration in `config.json`, which includes:
- Base game folder path
- Mod folder path

## Acknowledgments

- Sins of a Solar Empire II developers for the amazing game and the tools they have provided
- All the modders who created the mods that I have used in testing
- PyQt6 framework
- Pygame (for the sound preview)
